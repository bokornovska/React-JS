## About the project
Design Blog  is an app that serves as an site that focuses on sharing inspiration trough a community of designers. The site has authentication that creates a user upon registering and saves it for later logging in. Users can publish their own designs. Once published, the design is displayed in the "Inspiration" tab along with all other designs created beforehand. The given user that created the design can edit it at any given time, whilst updating in the database or even delete it, removing it permanently from the database. Each other user that didn't create the given design can like it once, whilst a "likes" counter displays the current amount of likes on a specific design .Each user has a profile page in which they can edit thier profile icon, display name and short bio.

**Note: the project requires the sofuni-practice-server (located in the "server" folder in this repo) to be running at all times for everything to be working correctly.**
